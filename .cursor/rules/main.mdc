1. **Type Safety**
   - Use TypeScript for all new code
   - Maintain strict type checking
   - Avoid `any` types unless absolutely necessary
   - Use proper type imports (`import type` when importing only types)

2. **Performance**
   - Use React Server Components by default
   - Enable Turbopack for development (`pnpm dev` uses `--turbopack`)
   - Implement proper code splitting with `next/dynamic`
   - Follow recommended caching strategies
   - Optimize assets and bundles

3. **Code Quality**
   - Follow ESLint linting rules
   - Maintain consistent code style
   - Write meaningful comments and documentation
   - Use meaningful variable and function names
   - Prefer named exports for components

4. **Testing & Debugging**
   - Implement proper error boundaries
   - Follow error handling best practices

5. **Security**
   - Follow security best practices
   - Properly handle environment variables
   - Implement proper authentication
   - Follow CSP guidelines
   - Use server-side validation for forms

6. **Architecture**
   - Follow the defined project structure
   - Maintain separation of concerns
   - Use proper state management (Zustand when needed)
   - Follow component composition patterns
   - Keep client/server boundaries clear

## Technology Stack

- **Next.js 15.5.2** - App Router with Turbopack support
- **React 19.1.1** - Latest features including simplified ref handling
- **React Compiler enabled** - Automatically optimizes most component re-renders and memoization manual memoization is
  rarely needed
- **TypeScript** - Strict mode enabled
- **ESLint 9.34.0** - Linting and formatting
- **PNPM** - JavaScript runtime and package manager
- **Node 24.4.0** - Node js
- **Prettier 3.6.2** - Prettier Formatting

## Development Guidelines

1. **State Management**
   - Prefer React's built-in state for component state
   - Use Zustand for global state when needed
   - Keep state as close to where it's used as possible

2. **Routing & Navigation**
   - Use Next.js App Router conventions
   - Implement proper loading and error states
