# Project Patterns

## App Structure
- **Displays**: Code for large screens goes in `src/app/(displays)`.
- **Tablets**: Code for controllers goes in `src/app/(tablets)`.
- **Shared**: Reusable logic goes in `src/lib` or `src/components`.

## UI Components (Shadcn)
- Import from `@/components/shadcn/...`.
- Do not modify the core shadcn files directly.
- Extend them using composition or by wrapping them in a new component.

## Navigation
- Use `useMomentsNavigation` hook for linear presentation flows (Basecamp, Overlook).
- Ensure "Beats" are 1-indexed in the UI but 0-indexed in logic if needed, but consistency is key.

## State
- Use `useMqtt` context for anything that needs to cross the network.
